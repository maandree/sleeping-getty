NAME
	sleeping-getty - Do not start a fullblow getty before it is necessary

SYNOPSIS
	sleeping-getty VTNO GETTY_COMMAND...

DESCRIPTION
	sleeping-getty shall wait until VTNO (an number of a virtual terminal)
	becomes the foreground console. Then, it shall execv(3) to GETTY_COMMAND,
	with GETTY_COMMAND and all following arguments as the command line
	arguments.

	Note that this program ways on VT:s, not TTY:s. It cannot wait for a
	serial console to become, active, only virtual terminals.

EXAMPLE
	/sbin/sleeping-getty 15 /sbin/got tty15 TERM=linux

	/sbin/sleeping-getty 16 /sbin/got tty16 TERM=linux

	/sbin/sleeping-getty 20 /sbin/agetty -8 -s 38400 tty20 linux

RATIONALE
	It is nice to have a score or two of TTY:s available. However,
	starting them, can require some unnecessary CPU time and will
	was memory until they are actually used. This becomes extra
	important on resource contained machines.
