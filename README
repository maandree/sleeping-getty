NAME
	sleeping-getty - Do not start a fullblown getty before it is necessary

SYNOPSIS
	sleeping-getty vtno getty-command [arguments] ...

DESCRIPTION
	sleeping-getty shall wait until vtno (a number of a virtual terminal)
	becomes the foreground console. Then, it shall execvp(3) to getty-command,
	with getty-command and all following arguments as the command line
	arguments.

	Note that sleeping-getty works on VT:s, not TTY:s. It cannot wait for a
	serial console to become, active, only virtual terminals.

EXAMPLE
	/sbin/sleeping-getty 15 /sbin/got tty15 TERM=linux

	/sbin/sleeping-getty 16 /sbin/got tty16 TERM=linux

	/sbin/sleeping-getty 20 /sbin/agetty -8 -s 38400 tty20 linux

NOTES
	sleeping-getty does not acquire the TTY. That would be a waste
	of CPU cycles. This means, if na√Øvely used, that if you start
	your computer, log in on tty1, and start X, and have startx
	configured to start X on the next available VT. X will start
	on VT 2. This is probably not want you want. Instead you
	should edit startx to ensure that a VT lower than a preferred
	number (customarily 7) will not be used.

RATIONALE
	It is nice to have a score or two of TTY:s available. However,
	starting them, can require some unnecessary CPU time and will
	was memory until they are actually used. This becomes extra
	important on resource contained machines.
